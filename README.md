# Dish-Dash
Dish Dash, a fully interactive online restaurant app that I designed using Figma.

Dish Dash is a fully interactive and user-friendly app that allows users to order food from their favorite restaurants. The app features a sleek and modern design that is easy to navigate. Users can browse the menu, view photos of the food, and place orders with just a few taps.
I designed Dish Dash using Figma, a powerful design tool that allows me to create interactive prototypes. Figma gave me the freedom to experiment with different designs and layouts until I found the perfect one. I also used Figma's collaboration features to get feedback from other designers.

I'm proud of the work that I did on Dish Dash and I hope that it will inspire other designers to create amazing apps. If you're interested in learning more about the app, please visit my portfolio website.
